You are building a translation engine that takes a static image of a hand sign (A–Z) and predicts the letter. You must solve this problem twice: first using Classical Machine Learning (the "Control"), and second using Neural Networks (the "Experiment"). Finally, you must deploy the winner as a usable app.

 

A high-accuracy model in a messy Notebook is a fail. A lower-accuracy model in a clean, versioned, and deployed pipeline is a pass.

 

No pre-trained models allowed!

 

This will be completed over a three-week sprint.

Week 1 – Baseline Model with either SVM or Random Forest

Deliverable – Confusion matrix for the classical model.

Week 2 – Build a Multi-Layer Perceptron using PyTorch or TensorFlow

Run experiments with varying architectures (eg # of hidden layers, different activation functions.)

Track experiments using weights and biases

Deliverable – A Weights and Biases dashboard showing the loss curves of the neural net vs the random forest/ SVM model.

Week 3 – Deployment

Build a local dashboard (may use streamlit)

App must allow upload of a png of a hand sign and display the predicted letter and confidence sore.

Deliverable – Live demo and presentation
